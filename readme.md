This repository provides the all the necessary AWS infrastructure, and creates an EKS Cluster to which an application can be deployed.
It is intended to be used in conjunction with [my other repo](https://github.com/izetter/k8s-3-app), which contains the app to be deployed to the EKS Cluster created here.
